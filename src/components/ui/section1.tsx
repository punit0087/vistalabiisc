            Nestled within the vibrant academic landscape of the Indian
            Institute of Science (IISc), VISTA lab aims to advance cutting-edge
            research in the area of information and decision systems,
            unsupervised learning, graph machine learning, computer vision, and
            to apply these methods to tackle complex challenges across diverse
            societal domains, including transportation, environment, finance,
            energy systems, social networks, and healthcare.

            As technology rapidly evolves in areas like IoT, big data,
            communications, computing, crowd sensing, and social networking, it
            generates vast amounts of data that hold the potential for new
            insights. Our research focuses on understanding and analyzing this
            data, overcoming challenges related to scale, velocity,
            heterogeneity, and complexity, to extract clear and actionable
            insights.
