      "description": "India’s roads are constantly changing, but today’s methods of checking their condition—such as survey vehicles and central databases—are slow, expensive, and limited. At the same time, almost every modern truck, bus, or car already carries powerful sensors: accelerometers, GPS, cameras, onboard diagnostics, and often a human driver with a smartphone. Aftermarket devices and roadside CCTVs also generate valuable data. The problem is that all this information remains scattered across silos. This project aims to build an open and standardised API that can bring these different data sources together and make them usable for road monitoring at scale. By collecting simple sensor signals—such as raw accelerometer readings, GPS location, and camera feeds—we can crowdsource insights about road roughness, potholes, parked vehicles on highways, and sudden diversions. The API will be lightweight enough to run on both high-end and low-cost devices, designed to comply with Indian regulations, and resilient to patchy network conditions (so data can still be captured in low-connectivity areas). Ultimately, the project envisions turning vehicle fleets into rolling surveyors of India’s roads—creating a scalable, vendor-neutral way to monitor infrastructure, improve safety, and enable smarter planning.",

India, as a developing nation, is poised to construct a significant number of smart cities. However, the pressing challenge remains in designing and implementing an intelligent traffic management system, particularly in densely populated and chaotic traffic scenarios like those in India. The escalating traffic congestion, fuel consumption, and economic losses have underscored the urgent need for an efficient traffic control paradigm. Traditional traffic control methods with signal transitions have proven inadequate, necessitating a paradigm shift towards an automated traffic management system. Considering these aspects, this project aims to develop an innovative data-driven traffic control solution for a selected Indian city, targeting around 40 to 50 major traffic intersections, with the primary objective of ensuring a seamless and optimized traffic flow.",

      "description": "Clustering is an important unsupervised learning approach for (unlabelled) data mining that partitions the data into groups with similar objects to discover interesting patterns from the dataset. Deep learning-based clustering techniques have recently gained popularity due to their ability to handle complex high-dimensional data. However, these algorithms have limitations, such as the need to specify the number of clusters explicitly beforehand, the lack of information about the inherent cluster structure of data points, and difficulties in interpreting the neural network’s predictions. To overcome these limitations, researchers have used visual assessment of clustering tendency (VAT) methods to estimate the number of clusters present in data. However, these methods are not practical and are often inconclusive with high-dimensional datasets which is the case in most real-life data. Therefore, this project aims to develop an explainable, self-supervised learning-based visual-analytical framework for cluster structure assessment to discover the deep structures present in complex, high-dimensional data when no ground truths are available.",

We analyzed different types of driver-vehicle interactions during driving, investigated the effect of different driving conditions on drivers' stress, and explored the relationship between driver and vehicle in different driving conditions. The findings from this work could be used to help manage comfort-related in-vehicle intervention systems and could provide a continuous measure of how different external conditions (traffic, road, weather, etc.) affect drivers.",

These data often contain a great deal of information, which give rise to many location-based services (LBSs) and applications such as vehicle navigation, traffic management, and location-based recommendations. One key operation in such applications is the route prediction of moving objects. Vehicle route prediction allows certain services to improve their quality, e.g., if the route of vehicles is known in advance, intelligent transportation systems (ITSs) can provide route-specific traffic information to drivers such as forecasting traffic conditions and routing the driver to avoid traffic jams.\n\nMost trajectory prediction approaches in the literature use only synthetic or small to medium size real trajectory datasets because they are not scalable. The aim is to develop a framework for large-scale trajectory prediction which can be used for road networks of major cities. A scalable framework was developed for short-term and long-term trajectory prediction, based on our novel big data clustering algorithm and Markov models, which can utilize a large number (in millions) of trajectories in a dense road network. The developed framework was tested on two real-life, large-scale, taxi trajectory datasets from the Beijing and Singapore road networks in our experiments.",

Generally, the low-cost, low-precision sensor nodes have limited memory and processing power. Most techniques for sensor drift detection are not suitable for modern IoT deployment as they do not consider measurement errors/uncertainties present in low-precision sensor measurements. We developed an automatic sensor drift detection and correction technique by leveraging a Bayesian maximum entropy-based estimation method that incorporates measurement errors/uncertainties of low-precision sensors to estimate drift, with Kalman filtering to track and correct the estimated drift from sensor measurements. We implemented the proposed technique in both centralized and distributed frameworks to facilitate in-network sensor drift detection/correction in real-time. We extended this work for both smooth and abrupt drift detection using Interacting Multiple Models. The method was demonstrated using data from the Dockland Deployment in a distributed manner.",
